Happy Birthday

Hey, it’s me again,
and look who’s birthday it is today!

I know, I know. 
Where we left off was… super rusty yet again. It’s what they say: 
ending on good terms hurts like hell, so why not end on super bad ones, right?

(I’m joking)

((...if you still can’t tell))

First things first, I know we haven’t really spoken in a while, 
and where we left off wasn’t on a good note at all. I’ve been learning to respect the distance between us. 

For quite some time, I contemplated whether to reach out to you on this very day. 
So now, I want to take a moment to wish you well. 

This may be the first time I’m sending birthday wishes this way, 
but I genuinely hope your day is filled with joy, love, and energy from the people around you!!

You are undeniably the highlight of my 2024. You have a way with words that sparks the shit out of me. 
You made me believe in feelings I never thought I could experience. Changed my MBTI too tbh. 
Despite all the ups and downs, I’ve learned to forgive for the better part of the year, even though there 
might still be apologies that are due.

Well, forgive and forget, they say, right? And it’s obvious I have my share. 
So I’m sorry for everything, especially for the way I acted most recently. 
I don’t expect to be forgiven easily; when actions spoke louder than words, 
apologies won’t make a sound. May change define who we are, not just our apologies.

----------------------------------------------

Let new experiences shape you; don’t linger in places that holds you back. 
You’re that independent woman, after all. You know it haha

Your strength, perseverance, and determination are qualities I truly respect. 
Wishing you all the success you deserve in the year ahead. 

I hope you allow yourself to enjoy not only the big moments in your life but also the smallest victories too! 
As small as being grateful that you remembered to throw away some receipts from your pocket. 
Life is that great!

And yeah, if you’re wondering, no, this isn’t a template I got from the internet :P
I developed the whole thing myself (too smart to handle)

I wasn’t kidding when I said I contemplated; I really did. 
Thoughts were circling, considerations were considered, 
my brain was braining, and doubts were doubting. 
Then, on the night of 29/9/2024, I just thought, 

“Fuck it. Never wished her before anyway. If this is the first and the last, I better make it the best.”

So here we areee

No matter where life takes you, 
even if it's somewhere, some place or someone completely new, 
I'll always cheer for you, to the 10 out of 10 I know. :)

Happy Birthday, Alexa
