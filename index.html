                    You are undeniably the highlight of my 2024.

                <hr>
                <p>
                    You made me believe in feelings I never thought I could experience. Changed my MBTI too tbh. 
                    Despite all the ups and downs, I've learned to forgive for the better part of the year, even though there 
                    might still be apologies that are due.
                </p>

                <hr>
                <p>
                    And it's obvious I have my share. So I'm sorry for everything,
                    especially for the way I acted most recently. I don't expect to be forgiven easily, and it's okay;

            Let new experiences shape you; don't linger in places that holds you back. 
            You're that independent woman, after all. You know it haha

            Your strength, perseverance, and determination are qualities I truly respect. 
            Wishing you all the success you deserve in the year ahead. 

            I hope you allow yourself to enjoy not only the big moments in your life but also the smallest victories too! 
            As small as being grateful that you remembered to throw away some receipts from your pocket. 
            Life is that great!

            And yeah, if you're wondering, 
            no, this isn't a template I got from the internet :P
            I developed the whole thing myself (too smart to handle)

            I wasn't kidding when I said I contemplated; I really did. 
            Thoughts were circling, considerations were considered, 
            my brain was braining, and doubts were doubting. 
            Then, on the night of 29/9/2024, I just thought, 

          “Fuck it. Never wished her before anyway. If this is the first and the last, I better make it the best. (somehow)”
