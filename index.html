                    I know we haven’t really talked in a while, 
                    and where we left off wasn’t on a good note at all.

                    I’ve learned to respect the distance between us. For quite some time, 
                    I contemplated whether to reach out to you or not on this very day

                    This may be the first time I’m sending birthday wishes this way, 
                    but I genuinely hope your day was filled with joy, love, and energy from the people around you!!

                    You are undeniably the highlight of my 2024. You have a way with words that just sparks me. 
                    You made me believe in feelings I never thought I could experience. Changed my MBTI too tbh. 
                    Despite all the ups and downs, I’ve learned to forgive for the better part of the year, even though there 
                    might still be apologies that are due.
    
                    Well, forgive and forget, they say, right? 
                    And it’s obvious I have my share. So I’m sorry for everything,
                    especially for the way I acted most recently. I don’t expect to be forgiven easily, and it's okay; 
                    when actions spoke louder than words, apologies won’t make a sound. 
                    May change define who we are, not just our apologies.
